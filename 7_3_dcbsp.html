<META NAME="DC.DESCRIPTION" CONTENT="Website for the German BMBF-funded research project 'Management system for Precision Agriculture to increase the efficiency of farming and promote its environmental compatibility'. From January 1999 to Dezember 2002, site-differentiated arable crop production has been studied throughout Germany in this project. The central goal was to exploit the arable land more economically according to the principles of good agricultural practice and at the same time to cultivate it in a more environmentally friendly manner.">
